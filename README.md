This is my Personal website, code-named Crispy Giggle thanks to githubs randomd repository name system, plus i thought it was funny. 

This will be for me knowledge, as I try to make this from scratch to learn reactJs and any other tech that i might need to learn for web development. 

Notes as i go along:

Color Scheme i want to use... maybe:
#3490de, #60a8e5, #1f76c0, #111111, #2a2a2a, #000

- I am loosely following along with a tutorial for the styling. I am not a designer by nature.
- Trying out Styled components.. pray for me.
- Added react scroll... do I need it though?
- Apparently I had a typo in this file and my Desktop was not configured correctly so GitHub Shows my first 2 commits as unverified... oh JOY!
- I completed the "hero section" with some placeholder text and replaced the Nav text with a real png icon... that took way too long to add that in. I am thinking about an animation for it right now. I am also not going with the color scheme at all because I forgot about it... woops!
- I lied... I am using the color scheme a little... yay!
- Apparently I had a typo in this file and my Desktop was not configured correctly so GitHub Shows my first 2 commits as unverified... oh JOY!
- The basic Info Section component is complete and 100% reusable and editable! I want to try to make the Blog picture more dynamic and show the latest post instead of a picture in the future. I will worry about that after I get the posting process down. 
- I am starting to really like the reusable component with the data file and conditional formatting aspect. I already liked the component concept but making it even more dynamic has been a challenge that I am loving! I am still bad at CSS though... more work on that to come!
- I over thought the navbar and followed a tutorial a little too much with it... If I had a larger site, it would be nice, but I don’t need that many links in the footer so there is going to be a lot of unused code... I am ready for all the warnings! I also don’t have that much social media so that will be underutilized.
- I think I did it! the minimally viable product of this site is complete! I had to create a new button variant for external links, like to my GitHub, and I made some of the options in the info sections a little more modular with the data and variable file. Now is it time to figure out how to push this to my server and make it live!
- I can write the code... but cannot spell to save my life! Thank you to my friends who found my errors!
- I wrote the styling for the blog posts wrong. I was not thinking about pulling the data from the database, as well as looking at the horrible data file. the Data file is nice, but so messy, and not practical for dynamic rendering for a different ammount of posts.
