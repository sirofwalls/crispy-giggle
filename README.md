This is my Personal website, code-named Crispy Giggle thanks to githubs randomd repository name system, plus i thought it was funny. 

This will be for me knowledge, as I try to make this from scratch to learn reactJs and any other tech that i might need to learn for web development. 

Notes as i go along:

Color Scheme i want to use... maybe:
#3490de
#60a8e5
#1f76c0
#111111
#2a2a2a
#000

- I am loosly following along with a tutorial for the styling. I am not a designer by nature.
- Trying out Styled components.. pray for me.
- Added react scroll... do i need it though?
- Aparently i had a typo in this file and my Desktop was not configured correctly so GitHub Shows my first 2 commits as unverified... oh JOY!
- I completed the "hero section" with some placeholder text and replaced the Nav text with a real png icon... that took way too long to add that in. I am thinking about an animation for it right now. I am also not going with the color scheme at all becuase i forgot about it... woops!
- I lied... i am using the color scheme a little... yay!
- Aparently i had a typo in this file and my Desktop was not configured correctly so GitHub Shows my first 2 commits as unverified... oh JOY!
- The basic Info Section component is complete and 100% reusable and editable! I want to try to make the Blog picture more dynamic and show the latest post instead of a picture in the future. I'll worry about that after i get the posting process down. 
- I am starting to really like the reusable component with the data file and conditional formatting aspect. I already liked the component concept, but making it even more dynamic has been a challenge that i am loving! I am still bad at CSS though... more work on that to come!
- I over thought the navbar and followed a tutorial a little too much with it... If i had a larger site it would be nice.. but i dont need that many links in the footer so there is going to be a lot of unused code... im ready for all the warnings! I also dont have that much Social Media so that will be underutilized.
