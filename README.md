This is my Personal website, code-named Crispy Giggle thanks to githubs randomd repository name system, plus i thought it was funny. 

This will be for me knowledge, as I try to make this from scratch to learn reactJs and any other tech that i might need to learn for web development. 

Notes as i go along:

Color Scheme i want to use... maybe:
#34490de
#60a8e5
#1f76c0
#111111
#2a2a2a
#000

- I am loosly following along with a tutorial for the styling. I am not a designer by nature.
- Trying out Styled components.. pray for me.
- Added react scroll... do i need it though?
